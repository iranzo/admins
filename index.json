After spending some years enabling people in Red Hat on technologies related to migrations, publishing all the content for anyone to use (including Red Hatters, Partners and Customers) I got contacted by Packt asking me is I wanted to write a book. I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to write a book for quite some time with focus on the initiall stage of learning techologies related to computer science. As someone who started his professional career as a Sysadmin, the topic was completely on target Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Administration. Although, I\u0026rsquo;m not a fast writer, it takes me a lot to write a simple blog post or document, I took this as the chance to improve my writing skills.\nFirst steps: Outline and schedule The first step was to prepare the book outline with all the content to be included in the book. The focus was covering all the basic skills from the ground up, in a practical manner, adding tips based on the experience running systems in production. To make the content more relevant we decided to align it to the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator certification. As a Red Hatter who has gone through training, achieving RHCE and RHCA, I know there is no substitute for the well developed Red Hat Training materials which include labs with the chance to check the result as well as very practical, real-life oriented exam for certification that only with knowledge and practice you can pass. That\u0026rsquo;s why we oriented the book as the most complementary content possible focused on acquiring the skills as well as being an on-job reference to help before and after the certification process.\nAdapting and improving Once the outline was written, which by the way, was a good way to get started on writing, setting the stage for the book, providing the structure to project plan the whole process. Next step, defining the schedule, it was oriented to being able to write 1 hour a day. The friends at Packt did a great work there in preparing dates and allocating time to work. My first weeks were pretty stressful keeping up with my work during the day and with the book during the evenings, weekends and sometimes, nights. As the goal was to provide good quality content, I thought I needed some help. I contacted my friend Pablo Iranzo, someone who I have had the chance to work with. Someone who I call when I need to ask difficult technical questions and asked him \u0026ldquo;Do you want to join me in this adventure?\u0026rdquo;. Funny he also wanted to write a book, and share his experiences. We then rearranged the content to be created so we could do peer-writing, just like peer-programing, having time to write at a good pace and being able to review each other\u0026rsquo;s content.\nLet it flow Once everything was setup, we let things flow. Structuring each chapter into sections, providing content for thos sections while testing it step by step, formatting the content and delivering it for review. Thanks to or friends at Packt each piece of content had an editorial review, including ortography, grammar, flow and understandability; which made the whole text and images be easy to read; and also a technical review to ensure all the steps were accurate, comprehensive and functional. The first four chapters took some learning for Pablo and me but by the fifth the whole process was running smoothly.\nImproving the mix A very important new part in RHEL 8 was how containers were supported with the new tools: pdman, buildah and skopeo. Pablo and I considered this chapter so important that we wanted to put emphasis on it. After consulting with the editorial team we decided to ask Scott McCarty, the specialist on the topic, to write this special chapter. Luckily he said yes, even being extremely busy. But, with a bit of support (mainly on formatting) he managed to deliver the chapter. The icing on the cake.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a wrap Once the content was ready it was time to wrap it up. We did a full extra review with the final \u0026ldquo;builds\u0026rdquo; of the book cleaning up last typos, ensuring images had a nice resolution and all formatting was correctly applied. The cover image had to be selected and I thought about connecting things so I proposed an picture I tooks ome years ago, while in Brussels, of the Atomium. I suggested that to Pablo and Scott who liked the idea. We suggested it to the editorial team at Packt and they also liked it, moveing ahead at full speed to include it and provide initial mock-ups of the cover. I provided to pics so, we chose the one that suited the best. Now the book is available in Amazon to pre-purchase an it\u0026rsquo;s ready to be released on November 11th 2021. Hope you will enjoy it and it will help many people get started in the technology field that I love so much.\n","permalink":"https://admins.guru/blog/2021-10-03_the_story/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-story-behind-the-rhel-8-administration-book\"\u003eThe story behind the RHEL 8 Administration book\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all started in a fresh morning of November.

So, since January, I was enrolled in this effort :-)\nAs Miguel had an outline of the topics to cover for each chapter, it was easy to use the freedom we had to cover them, the examples, but of course, always having in sight the focus on the tasks that a system administrator would perform at RHCSA level. One of the metrics we had, was the expected page count, but also, it was flexible and some chapters were bigger than expected and some others, smaller, of course, depending on the topic and well\u0026hellip;. we finally exceeded in about 100 pages the expected page count.\nOn the tech side, I\u0026rsquo;m used to Markdown and I\u0026rsquo;ve used it at several roles in my career, and lately, I was doing Asciidoctor. I\u0026rsquo;m not a big expert in Asciidoctor but it had many features that I felt being useful for the book, however, to my surprise, the tool of choice was a word processor with some custom styling. I understand, that using a regular word processor makes it easier for other writers, and having version control was also useful, but still was a bit strange for me, as I was used to code reviews, easy to perform on text files, and also, doing cross-references between different documents. Even when working with SuSE on the manuals, the choice was LaTeX, which was even harder but allowed rich features on the final rendering.\nOn the other side, the Packt team provided good guidance for starting:\nStyling guide with some example documents demonstrating each style usage Shared drive for uploading the files and work on reviews And lot of support for the questions that arise And what was more invaluable: guidance by several members of the team about the styles to use, tense, writing style, etc\nThe process was quite fast, once each chapter was submitted, in few days or a week, there were some reviews and later, a technical reviewer did the same, providing a feedback form on the chapter and some other things to fix or improve.\nIn the end, going chapter after chapter, it went quickly through\u0026hellip; my biggest pain points were the chapters where I felt that there was nothing else to add, and writing just for increasing the page count was not something we had in mind, and of course, the Packt team supported us in the decision.\nI think that the hardest chapter was the two on exercises\u0026hellip; the book has two knowledge-check-in chapters and once the first was done, thinking about a second without repeating many of the stuff in the first one was not easy.\nJune arrived, all the chapters were delivered and some other reviews were still ongoing on the last chapters, so the book was almost finished and ready for the last steps.\nThe last stone in the road meant little effective work for us as it was mostly adjusting some of the wording and paperwork, but once we got clearance in September (close to three months to complete), we were able to move into the final stage.\nLooking back, it has been a good experience, which somehow was shaking the way I was writing before (as writing Knowledge Base Articles, requires using another styling for the phrasing, etc.), going more direct and engaging more with the reader, but very positive.\nFinally, when everything was done, another member of the Packt team did start over with the book, doing quality assurance, checking the content, clarity, etc, like a second Technical reviewer, before handing it over to the marketing team to work on the promotion of the book on social media.\nWill I do this once again? of course!\n","permalink":"https://admins.guru/blog/2021-09-15-the-experience-of-writing-a-book/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI wanted to write about my experience (before I forget about it), and as some colleagues asked about it\u0026hellip; here we go\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs published in the blog entry \u003ca href=\"%7Bfilename%7D2021-09-11-rhel8-administration.en.md\"\u003eRHEL8 Administration book\u003c/a\u003e, some colleagues and I wrote a book on RHEL8 administration, which can be bought \u003ca href=\"https://s.iranzo.io/rhel8\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany years ago I started one about Linux, but every time a new paragraph was added, a lot of new \u0026lsquo;TO-DO\u0026rsquo; items were appended as the information growth\u0026hellip; and as it was a \u0026lsquo;solo\u0026rsquo; project, I had other stuff to work on and was parked.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The experience of writing a book"},{"content":"After some time working on it, we\u0026rsquo;ve finally made it thanks to the support from our families and Packt, as well as several members of RH teams that gave the clearance to get it out!\nWith this book you\u0026rsquo;ll learn what is required to become a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Administrator and prepare towards the challenges you will face.
