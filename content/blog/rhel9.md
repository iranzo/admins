A lot has happened since we published about [RHEL 8 System Administration]({{<relref "rhel8.md" >}}) book was released...

A lot includes:

- RHEL 9 was released
- Many changes derived from the newer versions coming with RHEL9:
  - Deprecated options or software... and even configuration files

Thinking about helping our users, we've not been idle.. a lot of work has been done to bring up to date the contents so that you can use the book for RHEL9 System Administration and still get ready for RHCSA certification.
